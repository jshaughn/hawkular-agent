== SUMMARY

This command CLI utility allows you to send commands to the Hawkular Server over the https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-commons/tree/master/hawkular-command-gateway/hawkular-command-gateway-api[Hawkular Command Gateway] websocket,
which in turn can forward the command to the agent.

It can be run on the command line like this:

```
java -jar hawkular-wildfly-agent-command-cli-*.jar <options>
```

where options include things such as your credentials, the command you want to send along with its parameters,
as well as optional binary data.

An example command to deploy a WAR to a specific WildFly instance in inventory:

```
java -jar hawkular-wildfly-agent-command-cli-*.jar \
   --server-url http://myhost:8080 \
   --username myuser \
   --password myPassword \
   --command DeployApplicationRequest \
   '-PresourcePath=/t;hawkular/f;c15f9426-734e-4ee6-82d3-7b0d82c41a6d/r;Local~~'
   -PdestinationFileName=hello-world.war
   --binary-data-file=/home/me/files/hello-world.war
```

Refer to the https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-commons/tree/master/hawkular-command-gateway/hawkular-command-gateway-api/src/main/resources/schema[Command Gateway JSON schemas] to know what commands can be passed (the command name is the name of the schema)
and what parameters those commands support.
